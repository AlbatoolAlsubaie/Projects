## Key Insights for Presentation

I want the presentation to focus on the most major and somewhat obvious insights from the data to lay the foundation of the data the company must know. I will start with analyzing users genders, types and ages. The presentation will demonstrate that most users are males, subscribers and in their early 20s.
